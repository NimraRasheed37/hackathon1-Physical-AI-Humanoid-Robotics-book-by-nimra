- **Gazebo**: A popular open-source 3D robotics simulator.

## H

- **Humanoid Robot**: A robot with its body shape built to resemble the human body.

## L

- **LLM (Large Language Model)**: A type of artificial intelligence model trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like language.

## P

- **Physical AI**: A field of AI that focuses on developing intelligent agents that can interact with the physical world through perception, action, and reasoning.
- **Publisher**: In ROS 2, a node that sends messages to a topic.
