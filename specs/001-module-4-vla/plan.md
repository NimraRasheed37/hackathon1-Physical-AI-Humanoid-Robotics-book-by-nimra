# Implementation Plan: Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

**Branch**: `001-module-4-vla` | **Date**: 2025-12-24 | **Spec**: specs/001-module-4-vla/spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-module-4-vla/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

The primary requirement is to explain how large language models (LLMs) integrate with robotics to enable natural language understanding, cognitive planning, and autonomous humanoid behavior. The technical approach involves creating Docusaurus content structured into three chapters: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Foundations, Voice-to-Action with LLMs, and Cognitive Planning & Autonomous Humanoids. This module aims to equip AI and robotics practitioners with the knowledge to leverage VLA principles for advanced humanoid robotics development.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: JavaScript/TypeScript (for Docusaurus configuration and any interactive elements)
**Primary Dependencies**: Docusaurus, React (as underlying framework for Docusaurus). Key technologies discussed include Large Language Models (LLMs), OpenAI Whisper, and ROS 2.
**Storage**: N/A (content-based project, no dynamic data storage for the module itself)
**Testing**: N/A (content validation will be covered by manual review and Docusaurus build checks)
**Target Platform**: Web (Static Site generated by Docusaurus)
**Project Type**: Web (Content/Documentation)
**Performance Goals**: Fast page load times, responsive UI, efficient search within Docusaurus.
**Constraints**: Content must adhere to Docusaurus best practices for maintainability and extensibility. All content must be accurate and up-to-date with LLM, robotics, and VLA technologies.
**Scale/Scope**: Three comprehensive chapters focusing on advanced AI/robotics concepts for Vision-Language-Action.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

Given that `.specify/memory/constitution.md` contains placeholder content, a detailed check against specific principles is not possible at this stage. However, the plan aligns with the implicit principle of contributing structured, well-documented content to the existing Docusaurus site. Any future updates to the constitution should be reviewed against this plan. No violations are identified based on the current placeholder constitution.

## Project Structure

### Documentation (this feature)

```text
specs/001-module-4-vla/
├── plan.md              # This file (/sp.plan command output)
├── research.md          # Phase 0 output (/sp.plan command)
├── data-model.md        # Phase 1 output (/sp.plan command - N/A for content module)
├── quickstart.md        # Phase 1 output (/sp.plan command - N/A for content module)
├── contracts/           # Phase 1 output (/sp.plan command - N/A for content module)
└── tasks.md             # Phase 2 output (/sp.tasks command - NOT created by /sp.plan)
```

### Source Code (repository root)

The new content will be integrated into the existing Docusaurus site structure.

```text
docusaurus-site/
├── docs/
│   ├── module-1-ros2/
│   ├── module-2-digital-twin/
│   ├── module-3-ai-robot-brain/
│   └── module-4-vla/
│       ├── chapter-1-vla-foundations.md
│       ├── chapter-2-voice-to-action-llms.md
│       └── chapter-3-cognitive-planning-humanoids.md
└── [other Docusaurus files, e.g., docusaurus.config.ts, sidebars.ts, src/]
```

**Structure Decision**: The content will reside within the `docusaurus-site/docs` directory, organized under a new `module-4-vla` subdirectory to maintain logical separation and alignment with existing modules. Chapter files will be markdown (`.md`), with names derived from the spec's chapter titles (slugified). The `sidebars.ts` will be updated to include the new module.
