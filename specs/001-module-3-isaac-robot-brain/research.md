# Research for Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)

**Date**: 2025-12-24

## Summary

For this content-focused module, the "research" phase is primarily integrated into the content creation process itself. This involves thorough investigation and compilation of accurate, up-to-date information regarding NVIDIA Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, VSLAM, Nav2, and their application to humanoid robotics. Best practices for structuring and presenting this technical content within Docusaurus will also be considered during implementation.

No explicit "NEEDS CLARIFICATION" items were identified in the technical context that require separate pre-computation research tasks. The user's input directly guides the content areas.
