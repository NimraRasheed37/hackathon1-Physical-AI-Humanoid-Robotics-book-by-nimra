# Implementation Plan: Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)

**Branch**: `001-module-3-isaac-robot-brain` | **Date**: 2025-12-24 | **Spec**: specs/001-module-3-isaac-robot-brain/spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-module-3-isaac-robot-brain/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

The primary requirement is to teach advanced perception, simulation, and autonomous navigation for humanoid robots using NVIDIA Isaac Sim and Isaac ROS. The technical approach involves creating Docusaurus content structured into three chapters covering Isaac Sim & photorealistic simulation, hardware-accelerated perception with Isaac ROS, and autonomous bipedal motion planning. This module aims to equip intermediate AI/robotics practitioners with the knowledge to leverage NVIDIA's Isaac platform for advanced robotics development.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: JavaScript/TypeScript (for Docusaurus configuration and any interactive elements)
**Primary Dependencies**: Docusaurus, React (as underlying framework for Docusaurus)
**Storage**: N/A (content-based project, no dynamic data storage for the module itself)
**Testing**: N/A (content validation will be covered by manual review and Docusaurus build checks)
**Target Platform**: Web (Static Site generated by Docusaurus)
**Project Type**: Web (Content/Documentation)
**Performance Goals**: Fast page load times, responsive UI, efficient search within Docusaurus.
**Constraints**: Content must adhere to Docusaurus best practices for maintainability and extensibility. All content must be accurate and up-to-date with NVIDIA Isaac platforms.
**Scale/Scope**: Three comprehensive chapters focusing on advanced AI/robotics concepts for humanoid robots.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

Given that `.specify/memory/constitution.md` contains placeholder content, a detailed check against specific principles is not possible at this stage. However, the plan aligns with the implicit principle of contributing structured, well-documented content to the existing Docusaurus site. Any future updates to the constitution should be reviewed against this plan. No violations are identified based on the current placeholder constitution.

├── research.md          # Phase 0 output (/sp.plan command)
├── data-model.md        # Phase 1 output (/sp.plan command - N/A for content module)

└── tasks.md             # Phase 2 output (/sp.tasks command - NOT created by /sp.plan)
```

### Source Code (repository root)

The new content will be integrated into the existing Docusaurus site structure.

```text
docusaurus-site/
├── docs/
│   ├── module-1-ros2/
│   ├── module-2-digital-twin/
│   └── module-3-ai-robot-brain/
│       ├── chapter-1-isaac-sim.md
│       ├── chapter-2-isaac-ros.md
│       └── chapter-3-motion-planning.md
└── [other Docusaurus files, e.g., docusaurus.config.ts, sidebars.ts, src/]
```

**Structure Decision**: The content will reside within the `docusaurus-site/docs` directory, organized under a new `module-3-ai-robot-brain` subdirectory to maintain logical separation and alignment with existing modules. Chapter files will be markdown (`.md`). The `sidebars.ts` will be updated to include the new module.
