## Prompt

/sp.tasks

## Response snapshot

I have created the `tasks.md` file for the "Create a complete technical book on Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics" feature.

- **Path to tasks.md**: `specs/001-create-robotics-book/tasks.md`
- **Total task count**: 18
- **Task count per user story**:
  - User Story 1: 3
  - User Story 2: 4
  - User Story 3: 4
- **Suggested MVP scope**: User Story 1 (Beginner Learner Explores Concepts)

The tasks are now ready for implementation.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: The tasks for the feature were created and saved.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests were run as this was a planning and documentation phase.
- 📁 Files: 1 file was created: `specs/001-create-robotics-book/tasks.md`.
- 🔁 Next prompts: The user can now start implementing the tasks.
- 🧠 Reflection: The task generation process successfully broke down the feature into a series of actionable tasks, organized by user story, making the implementation process clear and manageable.
