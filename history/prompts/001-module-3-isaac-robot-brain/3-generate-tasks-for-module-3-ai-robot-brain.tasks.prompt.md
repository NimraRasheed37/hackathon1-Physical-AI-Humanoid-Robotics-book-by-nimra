## Prompt

/sp.tasks

## Response snapshot

The task list for "Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)" has been successfully generated. It provides a detailed, dependency-ordered set of tasks, organized into phases and by user story, including specific file paths and parallelization opportunities. This structured approach facilitates incremental implementation and independent testing of each user story.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: The detailed task list for Module 3 was successfully generated, outlining implementation steps organized by user story.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests were run as this stage does not involve code changes.
- 📁 Files: Created tasks.md for Module 3.
- 🔁 Next prompts: The task list is ready for implementation. Use /sp.implement to begin.
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully generated a comprehensive, dependency-ordered task list following strict formatting rules, suitable for incremental development of the Docusaurus content module.
