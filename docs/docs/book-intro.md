# Introduction to Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the exciting world of Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics! This book is your guide to understanding and building intelligent systems that can perceive, reason about, and interact with the physical world.

## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on creating embodied agents—robots—that can perform tasks in the real world. Unlike purely digital AI, which exists only in computer simulations or data centers, Physical AI agents have bodies and live in the same physical reality as we do. This introduces a unique set of challenges and opportunities, from dealing with the uncertainties of the real world to enabling robots to learn and adapt through physical interaction.

## Why Humanoid Robots?

Humanoid robots, with their human-like form, are a particularly compelling platform for Physical AI research. They are designed to operate in human-centric environments, use human tools, and interact with humans in a natural way. By studying and building humanoid robots, we can not only advance the field of robotics but also gain a deeper understanding of human intelligence.

## What You Will Learn

In this book, you will learn:

- The fundamental concepts of Physical AI and embodied intelligence.
- The basics of the Robot Operating System (ROS 2), the standard for robotics software development.
- How to build and test robot simulations in Gazebo, Unity, and NVIDIA Isaac Sim.
- How to use Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models to create intelligent robot behaviors.
- How to build a complete humanoid robot capstone project from scratch.

Get ready to embark on a journey from digital intelligence to embodied systems!
